# Classic-Arcade-Game
##Gameplay
Char Boy needs to collect some stars, but is allergic to bugs and HATES water! Use the keyboard arrows to lead Char Boy to collect the stars (which magically teleport him back to the starting area). Avoid both the bugs and water, and be careful; those darn bugs get faster and angrier when you take their stars!

## Instructions

To play the game download the contents of the repository and open `index.html` in your internet browser. 

## Project contents

The project is structured as followed:

* main folder contains the actual html page with the game, README amd other technical files
* `/css` folder contains the styling of the page
* `/js` folder contains the javascript file describing the mechanics of the game as well as minified version of the jQuery library
* `/img` folder contains the background image

The structure of the folders should be preserved for the website to work properly.

## Contributing

This repository is my personal project, which is a part of Udacity Front End Web development nanodegree. In principal I would like to develop it on my own, but usefull tips and additions to the code are welcome.
